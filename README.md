## Miscellaneous

Time duration: 10 Hrs.
I have completed all the points you mentioned and the bonus points I covered as follows:-

- Add an all text Resource view.
- Assume there are many pages and the response need to be paged.
- Add free text search for both table views (Assuming I have applied the search logic by page name through server side).
- Add option to create and edit pages.
- Use typescript.
- Use a state management framework.( I used Redux logics)
